[Intro]

C Am E G
C Am E G


[Verse]

C                Am  E             G
 In the suburbs, I    I learned to drive
         C                     Am   E                   G
 And you told me we’d never survive, grab your mother’s keys, we’re leaving
C Am E G

C                     Am   E         G
 You always seemed so sure, that one day we’d be fighting
C              Am  E             G
 In a suburban war, your part of town against mine
           C                        Am    E           G
 I saw you standing on the opposite shore, but by the time the first bombs fell
 C               Am    E                 G
 We were already bored, we were already, already bored


[Chorus]

C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
  C    Am E G
 Again


[Verse]

     C                Am   E          G
 The kids wanna be so hard, but in my dreams we’re still screaming
     C                   Am   E                G
 And running through the yard, when all of the walls that they built
        C                 Am   E               G
 In the seventies finally fall, and all of the houses they built
        C                 Am                         E              G
 In the seventies finally fall, meant nothing at all, meant nothing at all, it meant nothing


[Chorus]

C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
     C              Am E G
 And into the night
C Am E G


[Verse]

C                      Am E             G
 So can you understand,    why I want a daughter 
                 C    Am        E                 G
 While I’m still young, I wanna hold her hand and show her some beauty
   C                       Am   E            G
 Before all this damage is done, but if it’s too much to ask
         C              Am               E    G
 If it’s too much to ask, then send me a son
C                  Am E               G
 Under the overpass,   in the parking lot we’re still waiting
      C             Am E             G
 It’s already passed,   so move your feet from hot pavement
     C              Am                    E                   G
 And into the grass,  'cause it’s already past, it’s already, already past


[Chorus]

C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
  C   Am E           D
 Again,   I'm moving past the feeling
C Am E           D
      I’m moving past the feeling
C Am E G


[Outro]

 C Am E      G
       In my dreams
                   C Am E G
  We're still screaming
                   C Am E G
  We’re still screaming
                   C Am E G
  We’re still screaming
 C Am E G
 C Am
